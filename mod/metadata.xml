    <description>[h1][b]Fully playable alt path for Greed Mode![/b][/h1]

        In the base game, you can play with those floors via the debug console but boss waves and entire Gehenna and Corpse floors are missing.
        So I added the missing boss waves and 120 different waves for Gehenna and Corpse!
        I tried to copy the style of the other waves that are currently in the game.
        Downpour, Dross, Mines, Ashpit and Mausoleum enemy waves are the original waves currently in the game, i haven't touched them.

        Alt path floors will appear one floor later than their original stage ID in greed mode, with a full alt path run you can have something like that :
        Basement - Downpour - Mines - Mausoleum - Corpse - Shop

        [b]Q and A:[/b]

        [b]How does it work, I can only play alt path or are the new floors mixed with the existing ones ?[/b]
        You can do both! There's an option in Mod Config Menu to play like you want.

        [b]Is it compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2626756137]Greed Mode Improved Repentance[/url] ?[/b]
        Yes.

        [b]Are there double item rooms ?[/b]
        Yes, one visible and one blind item like in normal mode.

        [b]Clog spawned a poop on the greed button, i cannot launch last wave![/b]
        It's a vanilla bug, i can't do anything about that and I don't want to remove Clog sorry.
        Like you can use Ehwaz or We Need to Go Deeper to spawn a trapdoor on the Greed button. Hope it will be patched soon!

        [b]Where Rotgut?[/b]
        Rotgut makes the game crash when you enter phase 2. It is replaced by 2 red Wormwoods (yes, the one from Antibirth. Files are currently in the game so i used them)

        [b]I typed &quot;stage 1c&quot; in the console but i'm not in Downpour.[/b]
        I use the &quot;reseed&quot; command once per floor, so you'll have to type your stage command twice, sorry about that.

        [b]Do you plan to add Cathedral ?[/b]
        I want to! But it might not be possible since there's no file for it nor is coded in the game.

        [b]Is Henry here?[/b]
        Yes, i added a very rare wave in Dross with Henry!

        Thanks to Microsorex for letting me use his original code.

        If there's some bugs or if you find some waves too easy or too hard, you can contact me on Discord (Gamonymous#1546)
