    <description>[h1][b]Fully playable alt path for Greed Mode![/b][/h1]

        In the base game, you can play with those floors via the debug console but boss waves and entire Gehenna and Corpse floors are missing.
        So I added the missing boss waves and 120 different waves for Gehenna and Corpse!
        I tried to copy the style of the other waves are are currently in the game.
        Downpour, Dross, Mines, Ashpit and Mausoleum enemy waves are the original waves currently in the game, i haven't touched them.

        [b]Q and A:[/b]

        [b]How does it work, I can only play alt path or are the new floors mixed with the existing ones ?[/b]
        You can do both! There's an option in Mod Config Menu to play like you want.

        [b]Clog spawned a poop on the greed button, i cannot launch last wave![/b]
        It's a vanilla bug, i can't do anything about that and I don't want to remove Clog sorry.
        Like you can use Ehwaz or We Need to Go Deeper to spawn a trapdoor on the Greed button. Hope it will be patched soon!

        [b]Where Rotgut?[/b]
        Rotgut makes the game crash when you enter phase 2. It is replaced by 2 red Wormwoods (yes, the one from Antibirth. Files are currently in the game so i used them)

        Thanks to Microsorex for letting me use his original code.

        If there's some bugs or if you find some waves too easy or too hard, you can contact me on Discord (Gamonymous#1546)
